# MySlamBook (Android)

A modern, multi-screen Android app for creating, viewing, and managing personal “slam book” entries. It guides users through a three-part form with rich validation, lets them attach a profile photo (camera or gallery), and stores entries locally for quick listing, editing, and detailed viewing.

## Overview
- Multi-step form collects personal info, favorites, and reflections.
- Robust input validation and helpful feedback messages throughout.
- List screen with add, edit, delete, and empty-state UI.
- Details screen presents a clean summary of each entry.
- Local persistence via `SharedPreferences` and JSON (Gson).
- Profile image capture with Camera and Gallery, using `FileProvider`.
